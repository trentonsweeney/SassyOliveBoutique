Sassy Olive Boutique

Project:

The collective goal for our website was to create an interactive catalog for Janet Sweeney’s online boutique. There was already an official website, but we took it upon ourselves to create a new one that improved upon the original. We began the process with a wireframe of each page, and used our original code for the index page, to build the rest of the website. We used the information and similar color schemes from the original website based on the idea that Mrs. Sweeney had already chosen the design she enjoyed. The logo we used, was one that Mrs. Sweeney had designed herself and appears on each page.

Color Scheme/ Design:

In our rendition of the Sassy Olive Boutique website, we chose to use colors that differed from the hot pink and aquamarine in in the logo, but still complimented it. Our colors consisted of a softer pink, and a baby blue with a teal outline around the logo itself. Along with a change to the original color scheme, we also used CSS to incorporate a baby blue dotted border around each page of the website and a white dotted border around each individual image in our columns to add a little flare and tie in with the colors of the logo. 

NavBar: 

Our NavBar provided a challenge for the people in our group. In our wireframe, we wanted to have an active NavBar that contained a dropdown section for the five extra pages of information. After trial and error of different code and spacing, we managed to create an active NavBar where the active button turns white with pink lettering to differ from the usual blue buttons with white lettering. We created the dropdown section after creating each page of clothing aside form the index/ Home page, and used it to create the order for our website.

Index/Home Page:

The index page is comprised of the NavBar and three columns that each contain presenting the sections in the catalog. The images representing our sections in the catalog. The columns were hard to create, and we had many problems aligning our information with the images. Originally, we had used generic column code, but the dimensions were not suitable for our page. Because of this, we had to find a way to outline each column to see how to better proportion the margins and column size. Along with aligning each image and price in the columns, we outlined each individual image in white polka dots to contrast from the background and tie them to dotted outline on the whole page.

About Us page:

The About Us page is designed differently than the three column style of the other pages. The navigation bar, logo, and dotted border are all consistent, but we inserted a paragraph with the Sassy Olive boutique mission statement and information on the function of the website. An image of the business owner and her family is located at the base of the page to make the website more personable and relatable. We thought that it might be beneficial for customers to feel a personal connection to the business owner.

Individual Clothing pages/Body:

The five pages presented in the dropdown portion of the navigation bar are devoted to different articles of clothing. The dresses, tunics, pants, tops, and accessories are each designed very similarly to the index page. Each of the catalog pages is divided into the same three columns that are written in the code on our main CSS page. Although the code is ultimately the same to create the body of the index and catalog pages, we spent a few days inserting each image, price, and description into their proper places in the column. 

Final Thoughts: 

Although our’s is not the first Sassy Olive Boutique Website, we did manage to use the original idea and improve upon the color scheme, navigation bar, and overall presentation of the information for the customers. The business owner, Mrs. Sweeney, was very impressed with our website and enjoyed the slight changes to the original idea.
